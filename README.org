  projects in Natural Language Processing

  In this repository I showcase solutions to common NLP tasks.

** Projects
   Each sub directory contains documentation and code related to a
   specific project.
   1. [[./01-neural-sentence-picker][neural-sentence-picker]] - given two sentences that look alike,
      output the one that is more likely to occur in text.

** How to
   1. Install the required packages: ~pip install -r requirements.txt~;
   2. Visit a sub directory and run ~main.py~.
